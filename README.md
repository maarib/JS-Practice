Stuff that will be covered:

***

MDN's JavaScript Guide - After the launch MDN quickly became the de-facto reference for JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Their guide is very solid, covering things like grammar and types, loops, functions, expressions, numbers and dates, text formatting, etc.

You Don't Know JS - This is a book series by Kyle Simpson, where he dives into trickier parts of the language, talking about what scope & closures are, what is an object prototype and what is "this" in JavaScript. This series will take your skills up a level, giving you a thorough understanding of JavaScriptâ€”including the parts that many experienced programmers simply avoid.

Eloquent JavaScript - Another great free book about JavaScript, although I won't recommend it to the people who are just learning programming. If you have some previous experience with another programming language, go for it, otherwise, choose some of the other resources.

Free Code Camp - Free Code Camp is a community where you will work through self-paced coding challenges, build projects, and earn certificates. It's really fun to do and can be done simultaneously with any of the other resources.

CodeCademy - Another platform for JavaScript challenges. It's very beginner oriented and easy to use.
